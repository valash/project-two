### Project Idea

Based on the Google Keep app, I want to make **Manage**, an app based on the same principles. Every user can have their own account that allows the user to access their entries and has the ability to update, edit, and delete all entries within their account. 

### userstories 
As a user of _*manage*_ I want to be able to keep track of all of my entries(notes), so that I am organized?


*HAVE TO ADD*
• What models are you going to have?
• What will the properties of those models be?
• What parts of CRUD will you have on each model?
