### MANAGE

Based on the Google Keep app, I want to make **Manage**, an app based on the same principles. Every user can have their own account that allows the user to access their entries and has the ability to update, edit, and delete all entries within their account.

## Development Process

First I started with a planning session on how I hoped my app would turn out. I definitely did not spend enough time planning my app I found myself getting lost very quickly in my routes and controllers and whenever I ran into an issue I slowly saw my code turning into almost an exact replica of WDI28-to-do-App. So what I would do differently is not rely on class work so much to create this site.
